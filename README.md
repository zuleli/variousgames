Statistics about Roulette Game winning possibility

These are several casino games. Roulette stimulates Casio Roulette game. You can set the repeat time and it can run Roulette game automatically. Your total win or lose can be displayed in chart. 6 lines in chart each represents odd,even,red,black,0-18,19-26 number bet.In the long run,for example,if you run 500 or 1000 times, your total gain is almost always below 0(see tview.png),which means that you will always lose in long run! It can also display a specific kind of bet(odd,or even,or red...) in the chart(see singleview.png).

Blackbet.java is actually a Baccarat game. The behaviour of this progrme is similar to Roulette. You can set the number of repeat and see the total gain in the chart(see bj.png).

Both Roulette and Blackbet require JFreechart API to run. You can download JFreeChart from internet.

The other 2 games can not run because it requires Oracle jdeveloper XYlayout API. I can't find this API so far. They were written many years ago.
